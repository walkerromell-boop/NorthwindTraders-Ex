// ============================================================
// SUMMARY: KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SHIPPERDAO AND CUSTOMERDAO
// ============================================================
//
// 1. DATA TYPES:
//    - ShipperID is int (number) vs CustomerID is String (text)
//    - This means we use getInt()/setInt() instead of getString()/setString()
//
// 2. AUTO-INCREMENT ID:
//    - Shippers: Database generates the ID automatically
//    - Customers: We provide the ID ourselves
//    - This is why the add() method is different - we need to retrieve the generated ID
//
// 3. FEWER FIELDS:
//    - Shipper has only 3 fields (ID, CompanyName, Phone)
//    - Customer has 11 fields (ID, CompanyName, ContactName, etc.)
//    - This makes the code simpler and easier to maintain
//
// 4. ADD METHOD SPECIAL HANDLING:
//    - We use Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS to get back the auto-generated ID
//    - We then set this ID on the shipper object before returning it
//    - This is crucial so the calling code knows the new shipper's ID
//
// 5. SAME CRUD PATTERN:
//    - Despite the differences, both follow the same CRUD pattern:
//      C - CREATE: add()
//      R - READ:   getAll() and find()
//      U - UPDATE: update()
//      D - DELETE: delete()
//
// This demonstrates how the DAO pattern provides a consistent interface
// for database operations, even when the underlying tables have different structures!
